# Vue Demo user interface

> This project has two pages, one for pure front-end data manipulation while the second communicates with a backend server

## Build Setup
1. Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/, this project is built using 8.9.11 but it should work with the latest one.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
# you need to enabled CORS on your browser to communicate with flask server at localhost:4000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
# the build output will be served by the flask server at localhost:4000
# Refer to ./projectRoot/server/README.md on how to run the server
npm run build
```
